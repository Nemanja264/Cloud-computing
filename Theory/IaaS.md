**IaaS -** is a form of cloud computing that delivers fundamental compute, network, and storage resources to consumers on-demand, over the internet, on a pay-as-you-go basis.  
The cloud provider hosts the infrastructure components traditionally present in an on-premises data center as well as the virtualization or hypervisor layer.

In an IaaS Cloud environment, customers can create or provision virtual machines (or VMs) in their choice of Region and Zone available from the Cloud Provider.  
These VMs typically come pre-installed the customerâ€™s choice of operating system.  
The customers can then deploy middleware, install applications, and run workloads on these VMs.  
They can also and create storage for their workloads and backups.  
Cloud providers often provide customers the ability to track and monitor the performance and usage of their cloud services and manage disaster recovery.
