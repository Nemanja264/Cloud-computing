**IaaS -** is a form of cloud computing that delivers fundamental compute, network, and storage resources to consumers on-demand, over the internet, on a pay-as-you-go basis.  
The cloud provider hosts the infrastructure components traditionally present in an on-premises data center as well as the virtualization or hypervisor layer.

In an IaaS Cloud environment, customers can create or provision virtual machines (or VMs) in their choice of Region and Zone available from the Cloud Provider.  
These VMs typically come pre-installed the customerâ€™s choice of operating system.  
The customers can then deploy middleware, install applications, and run workloads on these VMs.  
They can also and create storage for their workloads and backups.  
Cloud providers often provide customers the ability to track and monitor the performance and usage of their cloud services and manage disaster recovery.

**Key components of cloud infrastructure:**  
   **1)Physical data centers:**  
         IaaS providers manage large data centers that contain the physical machines required to power the various layers of abstraction on top of them.  
         In most IaaS models, end users do not interact directly with the physical infrastructure but experience it as a service provided to them.  
         
   **2)Compute:**    
         IaaS providers manage the hypervisors and end-users programmatically provision virtual instances with desired amounts of compute, memory, and storage             resources.  
         Cloud compute typically comes with supporting services like auto scaling and load balancing that provide scalability and high performance.  
         
   **3)Network:**  
          Users get access to networking resources on the cloud through virtualization or programmatically, through APIs.   
    
   **4)Storage:**
          There are **three types of cloud data storage: object, file, and block storage.**  
          **Object storage** is the most common mode of storage in the cloud, given that it is highly distributed and resilient.
