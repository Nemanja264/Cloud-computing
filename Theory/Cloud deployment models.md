**1) Public Cloud**  
Users get access to servers, storage, network, security, and applications as services delivered by cloud service providers over the internet. 
Using web consoles and APIs, users can provision the resources and services they need.  

**The cloud provider owns, manages, provisions, and maintains the infrastructure, renting it out to customers** either for a subscription charge or usage-based fee.  
**Users don’t own the servers their applications run on or storage their data consumes, or manage the operations of the servers, or even determine how the platforms are maintained.**

User does not have any control over the computing environment and is subject to the performance and security of the cloud provider’s infrastructure.
**providers: (Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, IBM Cloud, Google Cloud Platform, and Alibaba Cloud)**

*Characteristics:*
On-demand resources
The sheer number of server and network resources available on the public cloud means that a public cloud is highly available  
if one physical component fails, the service still runs unaffected on the remaining available components.

**2) Private Cloud**  


**3) Community Cloud**  


**4) Hybrid Cloud**
