**PaaS** - is a cloud computing model that provides customers a complete platform to:  
**develop, deploy, manage and run applications** created by them or acquired from a third party.  

***The PaaS provider hosts everything: servers, networks, storage, operating system, application runtimes, APIs, middleware, databases and other tools at their data center.***  
***The provider also takes responsibility for the installation, configuration, and operation of the application infrastructure, leaving the user responsible for only the application code and its maintenance.***
